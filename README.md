<!-- PROJECT SUMMARY -->
## Project Summary

The goal of this analysis is to take a look at Donald Trump's twitter account and the general themes his messages convey. NLP and sentiment analysis algorimthms will allow us to classify key words used in his tweets in order to provide an aggregated view of his sentiments. Since tweets are very noisy, many steps will have to be taken to ensure the accuracy of our analysis of a dataset that has high sparseness and is highly dimensional. In order to use our K-means algorithm we will be using TF-IDF and PCA so that we can try to reduce the impact of the noise. This project was built using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) along with many different packages outlined in `Trump_Tweets_2020.R`.
